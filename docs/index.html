  <h2>Some Quotes</h2>
  
  
    <ul>
      
        <li>Some people see things that are and ask, Why? Some people dream of things that never were and ask, Why not? Some people have to go to work and don&rsquo;t have time for all that.</li>
      
        <li>Don&rsquo;t tech your children to read&hellip; teach them to <em>question</em> what they read, teach them to question everything.</li>
      
        <li>Trying to be happy by accumulating possessions is like trying to satisfy hunger by taping sanwiches all over your body</li>
      
        <li>Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot and anyone going faster is a maniac?</li>
      
        <li>Think off-center</li>
      
        <li>It&rsquo;s all bullshit, and it&rsquo;s bad for ya</li>
      
        <li>Not only do I not know what&rsquo;s going on, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do about it if I did.</li>
      
        <li>Seven dirty words</li>
